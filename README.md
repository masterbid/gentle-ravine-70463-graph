AUTHENTICATION system using JWT.

The portal also implements a secure but flexible USER PERMISSIONS system which allocates priviledges to the different types/category of users.

The portal is built with a MERNG (Mongodb, Express, React, Node.js, GraphQL) stack. Other technologies using are Redux Toolkit, Webpack 5 Module federation and PWA(Progressive Web App) for mobile App experience.
